# You are tasked with designing a Python program, define a two numbers num1 and num2 and execute the following operations:
# 1. Calculate and display the sum of the two numbers.
# 2. Determine and show the result of subtracting the second number from the first.
# 3. Compute and print the product of the two numbers.
# 4. Find the quotient of dividing the first number by the second and output the result.

# Make sure your program handles unexpected situations well and gives clear and simple output for every operation.

# Output:
# Let's suppose the first number: 8 and the second number: 3
# 1. Sum of the two numbers: 11
# 2. Result of subtraction: 5
# 3. Product of the two numbers: 24
# 4. Quotient of division: 2.6666666666666665
